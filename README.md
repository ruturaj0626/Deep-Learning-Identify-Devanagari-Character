# Deep Learning for Devanagari Character Identification

![Devanagari Characters](devanagari_sample.png)

This repository contains code and resources for training and evaluating a deep learning model to identify Devanagari characters. The Devanagari script is used for writing several South Asian languages, including Hindi, Sanskrit, Nepali, Marathi, and more.

The goal of this project is to develop a robust deep learning model that can accurately classify individual characters from the Devanagari script. This model can have applications in optical character recognition (OCR), language processing, and cultural heritage preservation.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [Devanagari Handwritten Character Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rishianand/devanagari-character-dataset). It consists of thousands of labeled images of Devanagari characters. You can download the dataset from Kaggle and organize it as follows:

```
dataset/
    training/
        character_1/
            image1.png
            image2.png
            ...
        character_2/
            image1.png
            image2.png
            ...
        ...
    testing/
        character_1/
            image1.png
            image2.png
            ...
        character_2/
            image1.png
            image2.png
            ...
        ...
```
